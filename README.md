# **StoryPath - Native**

StoryPath - Native is a **location-based experience platform** that allows users to explore virtual museum exhibits, participate in treasure hunts, and engage in interactive tours. The app serves as a companion to the **StoryPath web platform**, which enables content creators to author and publish these experiences. The React Native app makes it easy for users to discover projects, follow clues, scan QR codes, and track their progress.
